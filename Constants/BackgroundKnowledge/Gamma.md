In General Relativity, the Christoffel symbols are tensors that encode the connections between different coordinate directions in spacetime. 

They describe how components of vector change as the vector is transported along a given coordinate curve. Intuitively, the Christoffel symbols measure the "angle" between two coordinate curves at a given point in spacetime.

More specifically, they can be thought of as a set of coefficients that describe how components of a ecotr field transform under a change of corrdinates. This allows us to calculate the geodesic equation, which describes the path that a particle will follow trhough spacetime under the influence of gravity.
