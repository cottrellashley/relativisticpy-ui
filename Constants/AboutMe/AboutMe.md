I am 26 years old, I was born in Brazil and spent half of my life in the UK.
I have a deep love for the fields of physics, mathematics and computer science.
My goal with this streamlit website is to share a simple general relativity 
calculator, which I have writen in python. I am a Software Developer for a living
but studied Theoretical Physics at university. I hope you enjoy, here is a link 
to my [GitHub](https://github.com/cottrellashley/General-Relativity-Streamlit-App)
