Basis Input format: 

$$[ b_1, b_2, b_3, ..., b_n]$$

The basis you input will act as the variables to which the derivatives are taken w.r.t.

* For example, with the following basis $[ r, \theta, \phi ]$, the calculator will opperate with the following derivatives: 

$$ [ \frac{\partial}{\partial r} , \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta} , \frac{\partial}{\partial \phi} ]$$
