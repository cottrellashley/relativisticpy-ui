We must make the following requirement:

Acceleration in flat-metric-approximation near body of mass M = Newtonian acceleration of gravity near body of mass M
    
Mathematically, this is what we do:
    
In the limit $r \rightarrow \infty$
    
$$ \frac{d^2r}{d\tau^2} = \Gamma^{r}_{t t} c c  \Leftrightarrow ma = - \frac{GMm}{r^2}$$
    
In comparing these two we can find that in the limmit $r \rightarrow \infty$ we find:
    
$$ - C_1 = r_s = \frac{2GM}{c^2} $$
    
And we therefore find the Schwarzchild Solution in it's full wonderful glory as:
