The goal of this project is to help make the subject of General Relativity more fun and accessible.
Many students who first enter this subject find all the equations quite intimidating and convoluted. The aim of this project
is to help you navigate this new subject with a little less resistance. We give a short backgroud knowlage in the next tab above. Additionally, we
provide even a simulated plot of how General Relativity is different to its older gravitational theory of Newton. I hope you enjoy this app!

Features Currently in Development:

1. Workflow page to allow users to continuously solve and manipulate their equations.
2. Dynamic symbolic solver. This will allow the user to input some string such as:
        "Metric^{a}^{b}Ricci_{a}_{b}"
    And get an answer based on the metric you have defined.
